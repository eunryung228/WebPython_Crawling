# WebPython Term-project Crawling Google PlayStore

This is the term-project "Crawling the goole playstore's game rank".<br>
It is developed by python, editor: Pycharm, Anaconda.<br>


I need some data "What kind of games player like to play?".<br>
So I need the rank of the games(Top 200), and the reviews of them.<br>
I crawled the rank, and the stars given by the player.<br>

And then I line up the games by the rank+stars_ranking, find and store the review-page of them.<br>
Then I crawled the reviews of them, and get datas in excel form.<br>
By anaconda, the excel files transform to list with word(in the review),<br>
I make a wordcloud by frequency of the words.<br>
